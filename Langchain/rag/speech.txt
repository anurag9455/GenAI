Officers and soldiers, two years ago, I came to be
your commanding officer
3. At that time, you were in the
Genoa River
4, in the greatest of miseries, stripped of
2 A city in southern France and large military harbor on the Mediterranean coast;
today the site of a large French naval base.

everything, having sacrificed even your most prized
possessions, all for the sake of your mutual livelihood. I
promised to have your miseries put to an end, I guided
you to Italy, from there, everything worked in your favor.
Have I not kept my word?â€”Well, hear this: you have not
yet done enough for our nation, and our nation has not
yet done enough for you.
I am now going to lead you to a country where,
through your future exploits, you will surpass even those
that today astound your admirers, and give back to our
nation the services that she rightly expects from an army
of invincible men. I promise to each soldier that, upon
the return from this expedition, he will have the means
to buy six arpents
5 of land. You will run from new
dangers, and will share them with our brothers, the
sailors. This navy, thus far, has not made itself
redoubtable to our enemies; their exploits hardly rival
yours; they have not had the same opportunities, but the
courage of the sailors is equal to yours. They strive for
triumph, and they will achieve it with you. Show them
this invincible spirit that has everywhere left you
victorious; assist in their efforts; get on board with this
intelligence that is characteristic of those who are
entirely animated and devoted to the sake of the same
cause. They have, like you, acquired the right to national
recognition, in the difficult art of the sea. Learn the
maneuvers of the deck, become the terror of our enemies
on land and at sea; imitate, in that regard, the Roman
soldiers who knew how to combat both Carthage on land
and the Carthaginian fleets
